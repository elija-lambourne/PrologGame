= Escape the Tram

== Ideas

So what was the starting point of this game. Well actually it was a real life occurrence that happened just a few weeks ago! We got stuck in the tram, on our way to Linz HBF. Some of us missed their trains, so we decided this could be made into a fun little text adventure. After this we had a brainstorming session where we came up with a story for the game! I am not gonna elaborate further on this, you can find all of this out by playing the game ;)

== Mechanics

Our game has simple mechanics, like walking, talking and using items. There are several fun little quirks with multiple bad and multiple good endings. Each Place has individual options that let you choose one or more. You can print a list of all commands by typing 'help.'
